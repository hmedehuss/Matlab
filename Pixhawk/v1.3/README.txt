    This is the instructional package for 'Multicopter Design and Control Practice'.
    The model in "e0" is mainly used for the introduction of the experimental platform, corresponding to the relevant 
content in Chapters 3 and 4 of the book.
    The last 8 chapters of the book correspond to 8 experiments, of which Propulsion System Design Experiment
has no relevant instructional package. Experiments 2 to 8 correspond to the contents of Chapters 6 to 12, and the
corresponding files are e2 to e8.
    There are three sub-files in each folder, which correspond to the basic experiment, analysis experiment and
design experiment in each experiment. Analysis experiment of chapter 2 has no source file package--"e2/e2.2",becasuse 
it mainly focus on theoretical calculation and analysis.

    The comparison between the instructional package and each experiment is as follows:
    e2:Dynamic Modeling Experiment;
    e3:Sensor Calibration Experiment;
    e4:State Estimation and Filter Design Experiment;
    e5:Attitude Controller Design Experiment;
    e6:Set-point Controller Design Experiment;
    e7:Semi-autonomous Control Model Design Experiment;
    e8:Failsafe Logic Design Experiment.
