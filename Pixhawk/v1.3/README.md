# RflyExpCode
This is the instructional package for 'Multicopter Design and Control Practice'. Please see https://rflysim.com for detailed information.<br>

# Introduction
The model in "e0" is mainly used for the introduction of the experimental platform, corresponding to the relevant  content in Chapters 3 and 4 of the book.<br>
The last 8 chapters of the book correspond to 8 experiments, of which Propulsion System Design Experiment has no relevant instructional package. Experiments 2 to 8 correspond to the contents of Chapters 6 to 12, and the corresponding files are e2 to e8.<br>
There are three sub-files in each folder, which correspond to the basic experiment, analysis experiment and design experiment in each experiment. Analysis experiment of chapter 2 has no source file package--"e2/e2.2",becasuse  it mainly focus on theoretical calculation and analysis.<br>

# Details 
The comparison between the instructional package and each experiment is as follows:<br>
e2:Dynamic Modeling Experiment;<br>
e3:Sensor Calibration Experiment;<br>
e4:State Estimation and Filter Design Experiment;<br>
e5:Attitude Controller Design Experiment;<br>
e6:Set-point Controller Design Experiment;<br>
e7:Semi-autonomous Control Model Design Experiment;<br>
e8:Failsafe Logic Design Experiment.<br>

# Notice
We don't provid design experiment package for students, and the code begining with "%@ " should be compeleted to make it right to run.If you can be certified as a teacher, we will give you all the packages.
