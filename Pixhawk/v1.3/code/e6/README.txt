    You can do basic experiment using the models in 'e6\e6.1'.
    'e6\e6.1\Sim' is used for Simulink simulation of a quadcopter and analyzing the channel decopling between the 
control along obxb and obyb axes.
    'e6\e6.1\tune' is used for analyzing the performance of the control system.
    'e6\e6.1\HIL' is used for performing the HIL simulation.

    The Simulink model in 'e6\e6.2' is similar to that in 'e6\e6.1\tune', which is uesd for adjusting and analyzing
the performance of the position control system based on attitude contorl system.

    'e6\e6.3' contains the position control model we design in analysis experiment.

    'e6\e6.4' contains the file for flight test and flight data analysis.Before you open the file 
'e6\e6.4\PosControl_FLY.slx', you'd better add custom logger data.
