    This instruction package is used for Semi-Autonomous Control(SAC).The SAC is based on the attitude controller
in 'e5' and position control in 'e6'.The SAC involves three modes, that is stabilize mode, altitude hold mode and 
loiter mode.
    'e7\e7.1' is used for Simulink simulation of a quadcopter and analyzing the characteristics of stabilize mode.
    'e7\e7.2' is used for analyzing the characteristics of the altitude hold mode.
    'e7\e7.3' is used for analyzing the characteristics of the loiter mode.And it contains a mode switch model in 'e7\e7.3\HIL'.
    'e7\e7.4' is uesd for flight test on mode switch.
